# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.1.2.0] - 2026-04-23

### Added
- Shared inline form validation across auth and onboarding. Fields now show real-time "Enter a valid email address"-style feedback and the submit button stays disabled until every input actually satisfies its contract.
- Review workspace recovery screen. When a review deep link resolves to a review your current workspace does not own, you now see a clear explanation plus "Open review queue" and "Open campaigns" next steps instead of a blank page.

### Fixed
- Review detail deep links survive the login redirect, so opening a shared `/review/[reviewId]` URL while signed out lands you back on that exact review after auth, not the dashboard.
- Onboarding handoff and navigation: the resume page honors pending state, browser history no longer strands you on a broken step, and step-one validation blocks empty submits before they fire.
- Dashboard campaign-start failures now surface a visible error banner instead of silently swallowing the failure.
- Contact page replaces the "Contact intake is not available yet" dead end with a `support@sugarandleather.com` mailto action, so users can actually reach support.
- Homepage request-access form validates inputs inline and keeps the submit disabled until the form is valid, with a dedicated loading state while the request is in flight.
- Forgot-password and login screens share the same inline validation contract as signup, removing divergent error copy across auth forms.
- Signup email addresses are normalized (trim + lowercase) before submission so duplicate-account checks match the real stored identity.
- Docker production port publish moved into `docker-compose.yml` base so deploys and production-style runs expose `${PORT:-3000}` without depending on the local override being layered in.
- CI deploy workflow checks out over HTTPS with the workflow token, unblocking the self-hosted deploy host when SSH origin access is not available.

### For contributors
- Added `lib/form-validation.ts` as the shared primitive behind inline validation (`EMAIL_ADDRESS_REGEX`, `isValidEmailAddress`, `getRequiredFieldError`, `getEmailFieldError`, `useDisabledUntilValid`).
- Added `frontend/aries-v1/review-recovery.ts` as the workspace-recovery state builder consumed by the review detail screen.
- Added GitHub issue templates (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md`, `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md`) so incoming bug and feature reports arrive with consistent structure.
- New regression specs pinned to this wave: `tests/login-form-validation.regression-010.test.ts`, `tests/forgot-password-form-validation.regression-011.test.ts`, `tests/onboarding-step-one-validation.regression-012.test.ts`, `tests/homepage-request-access-validation.regression-013.test.ts`, `tests/route-metadata-and-docs-anchors.regression-015.test.ts`, `tests/deploy-workflow-self-hosted.regression-015.test.ts`, `tests/homepage-request-access-loading.regression-016.test.ts`, `tests/production-compose-port-publish.regression-016.test.ts`, `tests/signup-email-normalization.regression-017.test.ts`.

## [0.1.1.0] - 2026-04-23

### Fixed
- Blocked signup submission until full name, email, and password all satisfy real validation requirements.
- Removed false click affordance from the homepage Meet Aries workflow chips and exposed them as non-interactive list semantics.
- Added Escape dismissal to the desktop account menu while preserving click-outside close behavior.
- Repaired stale encoded marketing text on campaign workspace and business-profile read paths before UI and API consumers render it.
